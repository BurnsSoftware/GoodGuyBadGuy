Good Guy and Bad Guy Down Range Targeting System

This is documenation, code, materials, and price sheets for creating an Arduino Nano or Uno controlled targeting system for the gun range via 12V DC portable power source.

I created this as an inexpensive alternative to the multi-thousand dollar units you can purchase online.  This will cost you approximately 40 US dollars to construct - provided you have an old car battery floating around.  You can increase the complexity and thus cost if you wish.

This system will allow you to take a 12V car battery, Gel Cell, or other 12V portable power source and place the entire setup down range of your local gun club or backyard shooting facility.  It of course assumes you have proper shielding, AR500 metal, dirt, etc. to prevent stray bullets (or bad shot) from striking and destroying the unit.

This system will randomly switch from a Good Guy silhouette to a Bad Guy silhouette anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds.  This gives you a chance to unholster your weapon, shoot, then re-holster your weapon in order to enhance your defensive shooting skills.

The time is also short enough so you can use a rifle and shoot at the target multiple times and not get bored waiting for a long time between Show Good Guy vs Show Bad Guy vs Pause routines.
